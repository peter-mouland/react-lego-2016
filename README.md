## _This is an archived version of react lego_

_This was useful when many of the technologies had breaking changes and exciting new versions in alpha's/betas.
With those being released now, I've archived this large repo to allow a new, smaller & cleaner, react-lego to emerge!_

# React Lego (2016) [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/peter-mouland/react-lego-2016.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/peter-mouland/react-lego-2016)

> The building blocks of a react app

This repo demonstrates how to plug in other technologies, one block at a time, into React.

### Hear me out!

The concept is to use GitHub's branch-comparison screens to quickly demo the code changes that are needed for *only* the technology you are interested in.

A client-side React app which is fully tested and production ready on the `master` branch.  
From Master, *Server-side Rendering (SSR)* has been added in the `Koa` and `Express` branches.  
Every other branch then adds one more technology, with the smallest possible changes.

All branches, have been setup with [continuous deployment](https://github.com/peter-mouland/react-lego-2016/wiki/Continuous-Deployement).

## Client-side

The client-side apps are production ready and fully tested, they both use the following :

 * [x] CSS ([Sass-loader](https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader), [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer))
 * [x] [tests](/tests/README.md)
  * [x] [unit](/tests/README.md#unit-testing) with [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme)
  * [x] [functional](/tests/README.md#functional-testing)
  * [x] [end-to-end](/tests/README.md#e2e-testing) with [Nightwatch](http://nightwatchjs.org/) and [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com)
  * [x] [smoke](/tests/README.md#smoke-testing)
  * [ ] [code coverage](/tests/README.md#code-coverage)
 * [x] Code linting with [eslint](http://eslint.org/)
 * [x] CI integration with [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/)
 * [x] Continuous deployment with [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/)

*All* other branches include the above and are also production ready.

### React

 > `master` branch

The react app uses [react-router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router) v2 for routing.

### Preact

 > [Compare Preact with React](https://github.com/peter-mouland/react-lego-2016/compare/master...preact)

Because of [Ben Fletcher](https://github.com/bjfletcher) and [this tweet](https://twitter.com/bjfletcher/status/776481240065114112) I thought i'd give [Preact](https://github.com/developit/preact) a shot.

Turns out it was actually very easy!  After removing a few dependencies we swapped routers for [preact-router](https://github.com/developit/preact-router).

[>> More about adding Preact](https://github.com/peter-mouland/react-lego-2016/wiki/Preact)

## Server-side Rendering (SSR)

### Koa

 > [Adding Koa to React code comparison](https://github.com/peter-mouland/react-lego-2016/compare/master...koa)

Using Koa, the App now renders on the server, [Compare Koa with Express](https://github.com/peter-mouland/react-lego-2016/compare/express...koa).

### Koa v2

With Async/Await around the corner and likely to be in Node v8, Koa 2 will soon come out of Alpha.  

I've created a Koa v2 app to see how _all_ the branches already mentioned come together in that setup.

[koa-v2-app](https://github.com/peter-mouland/react-lego-2016/tree/koa-app)

### Express

 > [Adding Express to React code comparison](https://github.com/peter-mouland/react-lego-2016/compare/master...express)

Using Express, the App now renders on the server, [Compare Express with Koa](https://github.com/peter-mouland/react-lego-2016/compare/express...koa).

## Importing CSS

In the base branches, we have simply added the CSS into webpack `entry` array to get it to convert Scss into CSS.
these are some other ways to achieve more modular components:

[>> More about the different CSS methods](https://github.com/peter-mouland/react-lego-2016/wiki/CSS)

### CSS Imports

 > Based on the `universal` branch _[compare branches](https://github.com/peter-mouland/react-lego-2016/compare/express...css-imports)_

Import your css into your component and use the class names as they are written.  
This method is the least obtrusive and feels most like traditional css.
You must manually take care of css scope using things like BEM or Smaccs.

### CSS Modules

 > Based on the `universal` branch _[compare branches](https://github.com/peter-mouland/react-lego-2016/compare/express...css-modules)_

Import your css into your components and add the class names using js object notation.
This method completely changes the css class names output.
Scoping problems are gone, but you must specifically mark 'global' classes.

### CSS in JS

 > Based on the `universal` branch _[compare branches](https://github.com/peter-mouland/react-lego-2016/compare/express...css-in-js)_

import your css into your components as Javascript Objects.  
Class names are a thing of the past as are scoping problems.


## Technologies to Add

### Webpack v2

See [how to upgrade from webpack v1 to v2](https://github.com/peter-mouland/react-lego-2016/compare/express...express--webpack-v2)

There are no code differences between Koa or Express when adding Webpack v2.

### React-hot-loader v3

[react-hot-loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/) allows you to see changes made to any part of your app without having to restart the server.
We are currently using [v3](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/tree/next).

See the code changes needed to :
 * [add react-hot-loader v3 to express](https://github.com/peter-mouland/react-lego-2016/compare/express...express--react-hot-loader-v3)
 * [add react-hot-loader v3 to koa](https://github.com/peter-mouland/react-lego-2016/compare/koa...koa--react-hot-loader-v3)

[>> More about adding react-hot-loader](https://github.com/peter-mouland/react-lego-2016/wiki/react-hot-loader-v3)

### React-Router v4

[React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) v4 sees to be very close to being released so I was interested in how hard the upgrade would be.
Easy, it seems - the new syntax includes a lot for JSX which is friendly and more flexible.

See the code changes needed to :
 * [Add React-router v4 to Express](https://github.com/peter-mouland/react-lego-2016/compare/express...express--react-router-v4)
 * [Add React-router v4 to Koa](https://github.com/peter-mouland/react-lego-2016/compare/koa...koa--react-router-v4)
 
[>> More about React-Router v4](https://github.com/peter-mouland/react-lego-2016/wiki/React-Router-v4)

#### Redux
 
[Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux) was added with data being hydrated on the server.

With Redux, the example app now has an API which can be called to return the required data.
This data is now formatted inside a reducer.

See the code changes needed to :
 * [Add Redux to Express](https://github.com/peter-mouland/react-lego-2016/compare/express...express--redux)
 * [Add Redux to Koa](https://github.com/peter-mouland/react-lego-2016/compare/koa...koa--redux)

[>> More about adding Redux](https://github.com/peter-mouland/react-lego-2016/wiki/Redux)

##### Redux with Promise middleware

 > Based on the `redux` branch. _[compare branches](https://github.com/peter-mouland/react-lego-2016/compare/express--redux...express--redux-promised)_

This branch allows you to make async requests on the server and hydrate your redux store before rendering the page.
The massive win here is that each container dictates what data it _needs_ while still on the server.

[>> More about adding Promise middleware](https://github.com/peter-mouland/react-lego-2016/wiki/Redux-Promise-Middleware)

##### Redux Dev Tools

 > Based on the `redux` branch. _[compare branches](https://github.com/peter-mouland/react-lego-2016/compare/express--redux...express--redux-devtools)_

Add [Redux-DevTools](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools) to the app to help debugging.

[>> More about adding redux-dev-tools](https://github.com/peter-mouland/react-lego-2016/wiki/Redux-dev-tools)

#### Importing SVG's

 > Based on the `universal` branch. _[compare branches](https://github.com/peter-mouland/react-lego-2016/compare/express...svg)_

Using [webpack-isomorphic-tools](https://github.com/halt-hammerzeit/webpack-isomorphic-tools) and [svg-inline-loader](https://github.com/sairion/svg-inline-loader) we are able to directly import SVGs into our JavaScript.
This has the added benefit of :

 * Reusing SVG files (without code duplication)
 * Keep SVGs inline and style them with CSS
 * Serverside rendering of SVG's
